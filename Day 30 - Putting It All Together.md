## 2. Problem-Solving Strategies

When approaching complex problems, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the problem**: Read the problem statement carefully. Identify the input, required output, and any constraints.

2. **Break it down**: Divide the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems.

3. **Pattern recognition**: Try to identify if the problem fits any known algorithmic patterns (e.g., sliding window, two pointers, DP).

4. **Consider multiple approaches**: Think about different ways to solve the problem. Consider time and space complexity for each approach.

5. **Start with a brute force solution**: Even if it's inefficient, it helps understand the problem better and can be optimized later.

6. **Optimize**: Look for ways to improve your initial solution. Can you reduce time complexity by using a more efficient data structure?

7. **Test**: Think about edge cases and test your solution with various inputs.

8. **Refine**: Clean up your code, improve variable names, and add comments for clarity.

## 3. Solving Complex Problems

Let's walk through solving a complex problem that combines multiple concepts:

### Problem: Shortest Path with Alternatives

Given a weighted graph representing a road network, find the shortest path between two points. However, for each road, there's a probability it might be closed due to construction. If a road is closed, you need to find an alternative route. Return the expected length of the shortest path.

This problem combines graph algorithms, probability, and dynamic programming.

### Approach:

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.

2. **Shortest Path**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.

3. **Handling Probabilities**: For each edge, consider both scenarios (open and closed).

4. **Dynamic Programming**: Use DP to memoize results for subproblems.

### Implementation:

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def shortest_path_with_alternatives(graph, start, end):
    def dijkstra(s, e):
        distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
        distances[s] = 0
        pq = [(0, s)]
        
        while pq:
            current_dist, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)
            
            if current_node == e:
                return current_dist
            
            if current_dist > distances[current_node]:
                continue
            
            for neighbor, (weight, prob) in graph[current_node].items():
                distance = current_dist + weight
                if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = distance
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
        
        return float('inf')

    memo = {}
    def expected_shortest_path(s, e):
        if s == e:
            return 0
        if (s, e) in memo:
            return memo[(s, e)]
        
        expected_length = float('inf')
        for neighbor, (weight, prob) in graph[s].items():
            # Road is open
            open_length = weight + expected_shortest_path(neighbor, e)
            # Road is closed
            closed_length = dijkstra(s, e)
            expected_length = min(expected_length, prob * open_length + (1 - prob) * closed_length)
        
        memo[(s, e)] = expected_length
        return expected_length

    return expected_shortest_path(start, end)

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': {'B': (4, 0.9), 'C': (2, 0.8)},
    'B': {'D': (3, 0.95)},
    'C': {'D': (5, 0.85)},
    'D': {}
}

print(shortest_path_with_alternatives(graph, 'A', 'D'))
```

This solution demonstrates the use of:
- Graph representation (adjacency list)
- Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path
- Dynamic programming for memoization
- Probability calculations
- Recursion
