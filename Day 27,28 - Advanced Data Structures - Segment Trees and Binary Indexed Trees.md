## 1. Introduction

Segment Trees and Binary Indexed Trees (also known as Fenwick Trees) are advanced data structures used to efficiently perform range queries and updates on arrays. They are particularly useful in competitive programming and in scenarios where you need to perform multiple range operations on a mutable array.

## 2. Segment Trees

### 2.1 Basic Concept

A Segment Tree is a binary tree data structure used for storing information about intervals, or segments. It allows for efficient querying of cumulative data for a given range (like sum or minimum).

Key features:
- Each node represents a segment of the array
- The root represents the entire array
- Each leaf represents a single element
- Parent nodes represent the combination of their children's segments

### 2.2 Implementation

Here's a basic implementation of a Segment Tree in Python:

```python
class SegmentTree:
    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.n = len(arr)
        self.tree = [0] * (4 * self.n)  # Size 4n is sufficient
        self.build(arr, 0, 0, self.n - 1)

    def build(self, arr, node, start, end):
        if start == end:
            self.tree[node] = arr[start]
        else:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            self.build(arr, 2 * node + 1, start, mid)
            self.build(arr, 2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end)
            self.tree[node] = self.tree[2 * node + 1] + self.tree[2 * node + 2]
```

### 2.3 Operations

#### Query Operation

To query the sum of a range [l, r]:

```python
def query(self, node, start, end, l, r):
    if r < start or end < l:
        return 0
    if l <= start and end <= r:
        return self.tree[node]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    return (self.query(2 * node + 1, start, mid, l, r) +
            self.query(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, l, r))
```

#### Update Operation

To update a single element:

```python
def update(self, node, start, end, idx, val):
    if start == end:
        self.tree[node] = val
    else:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if start <= idx <= mid:
            self.update(2 * node + 1, start, mid, idx, val)
        else:
            self.update(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, idx, val)
        self.tree[node] = self.tree[2 * node + 1] + self.tree[2 * node + 2]
```

Time Complexity:
- Build: O(n)
- Query: O(log n)
- Update: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

### 2.4 Lazy Propagation

Lazy propagation is an optimization technique used with Segment Trees to handle range updates efficiently.

Basic idea:
- Postpone updates to children nodes
- Apply updates only when necessary

Implementation involves adding a lazy array and modifying the update and query functions to handle lazy updates.

### 2.5 Applications

1. Range sum queries
2. Range minimum/maximum queries
3. Range updates
4. Finding the kth smallest number in a range

## 3. Binary Indexed Trees (Fenwick Trees)

### 3.1 Basic Concept

A Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree is a data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers.

Key features:
- Uses a clever binary representation of indices
- Stores partial sums in an array
- Extremely space-efficient compared to Segment Trees

### 3.2 Implementation

Here's a basic implementation of a Binary Indexed Tree in Python:

```python
class BinaryIndexedTree:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.tree = [0] * (n + 1)

    def update(self, i, delta):
        while i <= self.n:
            self.tree[i] += delta
            i += i & (-i)

    def sum(self, i):
        total = 0
        while i > 0:
            total += self.tree[i]
            i -= i & (-i)
        return total
```

### 3.3 Operations

#### Update Operation

To add a value to an element:

```python
def update(self, i, delta):
    while i <= self.n:
        self.tree[i] += delta
        i += i & (-i)
```

#### Query Operation

To get the sum of elements from 1 to i:

```python
def sum(self, i):
    total = 0
    while i > 0:
        total += self.tree[i]
        i -= i & (-i)
    return total
```

To get the sum of a range [l, r]:

```python
def range_sum(self, l, r):
    return self.sum(r) - self.sum(l - 1)
```

Time Complexity:
- Update: O(log n)
- Query: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

### 3.4 Applications

1. Cumulative frequency computation
2. Range sum queries
3. Counting inversions in an array
4. Finding the kth smallest element
