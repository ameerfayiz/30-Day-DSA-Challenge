## 1. Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are fundamental to computer science and software engineering, forming the building blocks for more complex algorithms and systems.

### Key Concepts:
- **Data Structure**: A particular way of organizing data in a computer.
- **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**: A mathematical model for data types where the data type is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user of the data.
- **Time Complexity**: The amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.
- **Space Complexity**: The amount of memory used by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

## 2. Arrays

An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. It is one of the simplest and most widely used data structures.

### Characteristics:
- Fixed size (in most programming languages)
- Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations
- Allows random access to elements using indices

### Basic Operations:
1. **Accessing elements**: O(1)
2. **Inserting elements**: 
   - At the end (if space available): O(1)
   - At a specific position: O(n) due to shifting elements
3. **Deleting elements**: 
   - From the end: O(1)
   - From a specific position: O(n) due to shifting elements
4. **Searching**: 
   - Unsorted array: O(n)
   - Sorted array: O(log n) using binary search

### Implementation in Python:
```python
# Creating an array
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing elements
print(arr[0])  # Output: 1

# Modifying elements
arr[2] = 10
print(arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5]

# Adding elements (at the end)
arr.append(6)
print(arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5, 6]

# Removing elements
arr.pop()  # Removes the last element
print(arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5]

# Inserting at a specific position
arr.insert(1, 7)
print(arr)  # Output: [1, 7, 2, 10, 4, 5]

# Removing from a specific position
del arr[3]
print(arr)  # Output: [1, 7, 2, 4, 5]
```

### Advantages:
1. Simple and easy to use
2. Fast access to elements (constant time)
3. Efficient in terms of memory usage for small, fixed-size data sets

### Disadvantages:
1. Fixed size (in most implementations)
2. Inefficient insertion and deletion for large arrays
3. Wastage of memory if the allocated size is larger than needed

## 3. Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic arrays are similar to regular arrays but can grow or shrink in size. They provide the benefits of arrays while allowing for more flexibility in size.

### Characteristics:
- Can grow or shrink in size
- Implemented using a regular array, but with additional logic for resizing

### Basic Operations:
1. **Accessing elements**: O(1)
2. **Appending elements**: 
   - Amortized O(1) - occasionally O(n) when resizing is needed
3. **Inserting elements at a specific position**: O(n) due to shifting
4. **Deleting elements**: 
   - From the end: O(1)
   - From a specific position: O(n) due to shifting
5. **Searching**: Same as regular arrays

### Implementation Concept:
1. Start with a fixed-size array
2. When the array is full and a new element needs to be added:
   - Create a new array with larger size (typically 2x the original)
   - Copy all elements from the old array to the new one
   - Add the new element
3. When many elements are removed, optionally shrink the array

### Example in Python (using list, which is implemented as a dynamic array):
```python
# Creating a dynamic array
dynamic_arr = []

# Adding elements
for i in range(10):
    dynamic_arr.append(i)
print(dynamic_arr)  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Removing elements
dynamic_arr.pop()
dynamic_arr.pop()
print(dynamic_arr)  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# Inserting at a specific position
dynamic_arr.insert(2, 100)
print(dynamic_arr)  # Output: [0, 1, 100, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

### Advantages:
1. Flexible size
2. Combines the benefits of arrays with the ability to resize
3. Efficient for most operations in the average case

### Disadvantages:
1. Occasional performance hits when resizing is needed
2. May waste some memory due to over-allocation

## 4. Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a data field and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### 4.1 Singly Linked Lists

In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence.

#### Characteristics:
- Dynamic size
- Non-contiguous memory allocation
- Sequential access

#### Basic Operations:
1. **Accessing elements**: O(n)
2. **Inserting elements**: 
   - At the beginning: O(1)
   - At the end: O(n) if we don't maintain a tail pointer, O(1) if we do
   - At a specific position: O(n)
3. **Deleting elements**: 
   - From the beginning: O(1)
   - From the end: O(n)
   - From a specific position: O(n)
4. **Searching**: O(n)

#### Implementation in Python:
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class SinglyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = new_node

    def prepend(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node

    def delete(self, data):
        if not self.head:
            return
        if self.head.data == data:
            self.head = self.head.next
            return
        current = self.head
        while current.next:
            if current.next.data == data:
                current.next = current.next.next
                return
            current = current.next

    def display(self):
        elements = []
        current = self.head
        while current:
            elements.append(current.data)
            current = current.next
        print(" -> ".join(map(str, elements)))

# Usage
sll = SinglyLinkedList()
sll.append(1)
sll.append(2)
sll.append(3)
sll.prepend(0)
sll.display()  # Output: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
sll.delete(2)
sll.display()  # Output: 0 -> 1 -> 3
```

### 4.2 Doubly Linked Lists

In a doubly linked list, each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes in the sequence.

#### Characteristics:
- Dynamic size
- Non-contiguous memory allocation
- Bi-directional traversal

#### Basic Operations:
1. **Accessing elements**: O(n)
2. **Inserting elements**: 
   - At the beginning: O(1)
   - At the end: O(1) if we maintain a tail pointer
   - At a specific position: O(n)
3. **Deleting elements**: 
   - From the beginning: O(1)
   - From the end: O(1) if we maintain a tail pointer
   - From a specific position: O(n)
4. **Searching**: O(n)

#### Implementation in Python:
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = self.tail = new_node
        else:
            new_node.prev = self.tail
            self.tail.next = new_node
            self.tail = new_node

    def prepend(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = self.tail = new_node
        else:
            new_node.next = self.head
            self.head.prev = new_node
            self.head = new_node

    def delete(self, data):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.data == data:
                if current.prev:
                    current.prev.next = current.next
                else:
                    self.head = current.next
                if current.next:
                    current.next.prev = current.prev
                else:
                    self.tail = current.prev
                return
            current = current.next

    def display(self):
        elements = []
        current = self.head
        while current:
            elements.append(current.data)
            current = current.next
        print(" <-> ".join(map(str, elements)))

# Usage
dll = DoublyLinkedList()
dll.append(1)
dll.append(2)
dll.append(3)
dll.prepend(0)
dll.display()  # Output: 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3
dll.delete(2)
dll.display()  # Output: 0 <-> 1 <-> 3
```
