## 1. Introduction to Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is a powerful technique that combines the correctness of complete search and the efficiency of greedy algorithms.

### Key Characteristics of DP Problems:
1. Optimal Substructure: An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.
2. Overlapping Subproblems: The same subproblems are solved multiple times when finding the solution to the original problem.

### When to Use DP:
- When the problem can be broken down into smaller, overlapping subproblems
- When the problem asks for optimization (minimization or maximization)
- When the problem has many possible solutions, and we need to find the best one

## 2. Key Concepts in Dynamic Programming

### 2.1 State
A state is a way to describe a specific scenario within the problem. It usually represents a subproblem that needs to be solved.

### 2.2 Transition
A transition is a way to move from one state to another. It defines how the solution to a larger problem can be constructed from solutions to smaller subproblems.

### 2.3 Base Case
Base cases are the simplest scenarios in the problem that can be solved directly without breaking them down further.

### 2.4 Recurrence Relation
A recurrence relation is a formula that expresses the solution to a larger problem in terms of solutions to smaller subproblems.

## 3. Memoization

Memoization is a top-down approach to dynamic programming where you store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

### Steps for Memoization:
1. Create a recursive function that solves the problem.
2. Create a cache (usually a dictionary or array) to store computed results.
3. Before computing a result, check if it's in the cache. If so, return the cached result.
4. If not in the cache, compute the result and add it to the cache before returning.

### Advantages of Memoization:
- Easy to implement (often just add caching to a recursive solution)
- Solves the subproblems only when needed
- Works well with problems that have many possible states but only a few are actually visited

### Disadvantages of Memoization:
- Can lead to stack overflow for very large inputs due to the recursive nature
- May have more overhead due to recursive calls

## 4. Tabulation

Tabulation is a bottom-up approach to dynamic programming where you start from the base cases and build up the solutions to larger subproblems.

### Steps for Tabulation:
1. Define the table structure (usually an array) to store subproblem solutions.
2. Initialize the base cases in the table.
3. Iterate through the table, filling in solutions to larger subproblems using previously computed values.
4. The final answer is typically the last entry in the table or a function of the last few entries.

### Advantages of Tabulation:
- Usually more efficient as it doesn't involve recursive calls
- Avoids stack overflow issues
- Often uses less space than memoization

### Disadvantages of Tabulation:
- Can be harder to implement than memoization
- Solves all subproblems, even those that might not be needed
- May use more space if many subproblems are unnecessary for the final solution

## 6. Classic DP Problem: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

### 6.1 Recursive Solution (without DP)
```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
Time Complexity: O(2^n)
Space Complexity: O(n) due to the call stack

### 6.2 Memoization Solution
```python
def fib_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fib_memo(n-1, memo) + fib_memo(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

### 6.3 Tabulation Solution
```python
def fib_tab(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
```
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

### 6.4 Optimized Tabulation (Constant Space)
```python
def fib_optimized(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

## 7. Classic DP Problem: Coin Change

Problem: Given an amount N and a list of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. If the amount cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

### 7.1 Memoization Solution
```python
def coin_change_memo(coins, amount, memo={}):
    if amount in memo:
        return memo[amount]
    if amount == 0:
        return 0
    if amount < 0:
        return float('inf')
    
    min_coins = float('inf')
    for coin in coins:
        result = coin_change_memo(coins, amount - coin, memo)
        if result != float('inf'):
            min_coins = min(min_coins, result + 1)
    
    memo[amount] = min_coins
    return min_coins

def coin_change(coins, amount):
    result = coin_change_memo(coins, amount)
    return result if result != float('inf') else -1
```
Time Complexity: O(amount * len(coins))
Space Complexity: O(amount)

### 7.2 Tabulation Solution
```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if coin <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```
Time Complexity: O(amount * len(coins))
Space Complexity: O(amount)

## 8. Additional DP Concepts and Techniques

### 8.1 State Reduction
Sometimes, we can reduce the number of states we need to keep track of, leading to more efficient solutions.

### 8.2 DP on Trees
DP can be applied to tree structures, often using post-order traversal to build solutions from leaves to root.

### 8.3 DP with Bitmasks
For problems involving subsets, we can use bitmasks to represent states efficiently.

### 8.4 DP with Probability
Some problems involve calculating probabilities, where DP can be used to avoid redundant calculations.

### 8.5 Iterative Deepening
A technique that combines aspects of BFS and DFS, useful for problems where the depth of the solution is unknown.
