## 1. Introduction to Advanced Tree Structures

Advanced tree structures are self-balancing data structures designed to maintain balance and ensure efficient operations (insertion, deletion, and search) even in worst-case scenarios. These structures are crucial for maintaining performance in applications that require frequent updates and searches on large datasets.

Key concepts:
- Self-balancing
- Tree rotations
- Height or color properties
- Guaranteed logarithmic time complexity for basic operations

## 2. AVL Trees

AVL trees, named after their inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis, are self-balancing binary search trees.

### Properties:
1. For each node, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most 1.
2. Balance factor = Height(Left Subtree) - Height(Right Subtree)
3. Balance factor must be -1, 0, or 1 for all nodes.

### Operations:

#### 2.1 Insertion
1. Perform standard BST insertion
2. Update heights of ancestors
3. Check balance factor and perform rotations if necessary

#### 2.2 Rotation Types
1. Left Rotation
2. Right Rotation
3. Left-Right Rotation
4. Right-Left Rotation

```python
class AVLNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.height = 1

class AVLTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
    
    def height(self, node):
        return node.height if node else 0
    
    def balance_factor(self, node):
        return self.height(node.left) - self.height(node.right)
    
    def update_height(self, node):
        node.height = 1 + max(self.height(node.left), self.height(node.right))
    
    def rotate_right(self, y):
        x = y.left
        T2 = x.right
        x.right = y
        y.left = T2
        self.update_height(y)
        self.update_height(x)
        return x
    
    def rotate_left(self, x):
        y = x.right
        T2 = y.left
        y.left = x
        x.right = T2
        self.update_height(x)
        self.update_height(y)
        return y
    
    def insert(self, root, key):
        if not root:
            return AVLNode(key)
        if key < root.key:
            root.left = self.insert(root.left, key)
        else:
            root.right = self.insert(root.right, key)
        
        self.update_height(root)
        balance = self.balance_factor(root)
        
        # Left Heavy
        if balance > 1:
            if key < root.left.key:
                return self.rotate_right(root)
            else:
                root.left = self.rotate_left(root.left)
                return self.rotate_right(root)
        
        # Right Heavy
        if balance < -1:
            if key > root.right.key:
                return self.rotate_left(root)
            else:
                root.right = self.rotate_right(root.right)
                return self.rotate_left(root)
        
        return root
```

#### 2.3 Deletion
1. Perform standard BST deletion
2. Update heights of ancestors
3. Check balance factor and perform rotations if necessary

### Time Complexity:
- Search: O(log n)
- Insertion: O(log n)
- Deletion: O(log n)

### Space Complexity:
- O(n) for storing n nodes

### Advantages:
1. Guaranteed O(log n) time complexity for basic operations
2. Suitable for applications requiring frequent insertions and deletions

### Disadvantages:
1. Extra space for storing height information
2. Complex implementation compared to simple BST

## 3. Red-Black Trees

Red-Black trees are self-balancing binary search trees with an extra bit of information per node: its color (red or black).

### Properties:
1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is always black.
3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

### Operations:

#### 3.1 Insertion
1. Perform standard BST insertion
2. Color the new node red
3. Perform recoloring and rotations to maintain Red-Black properties

#### 3.2 Fixing Violations
1. Recoloring
2. Rotations (similar to AVL trees)

```python
class RBNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None
        self.color = 1  # 1 for red, 0 for black

class RedBlackTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.TNULL = RBNode(0)
        self.TNULL.color = 0
        self.root = self.TNULL
    
    def insert(self, key):
        node = RBNode(key)
        node.left = self.TNULL
        node.right = self.TNULL
        
        y = None
        x = self.root
        
        while x != self.TNULL:
            y = x
            if node.key < x.key:
                x = x.left
            else:
                x = x.right
        
        node.parent = y
        if y == None:
            self.root = node
        elif node.key < y.key:
            y.left = node
        else:
            y.right = node
        
        if node.parent == None:

            return
        
        self.fix_insert(node)
    
    def fix_insert(self, k):
        while k.parent.color == 1:
            if k.parent == k.parent.parent.right:
                u = k.parent.parent.left
                if u.color == 1:

                    k = k.parent.parent
                else:
                    if k == k.parent.right:
                        k = k.parent

```

#### 3.3 Deletion
1. Perform standard BST deletion
2. Perform recoloring and rotations to maintain Red-Black properties

### Time Complexity:
- Search: O(log n)
- Insertion: O(log n)
- Deletion: O(log n)

### Space Complexity:
- O(n) for storing n nodes

### Advantages:
1. Guaranteed O(log n) time complexity for basic operations
2. More efficient rebalancing compared to AVL trees (fewer rotations)

### Disadvantages:
1. Complex implementation
2. Extra space for storing color information

## 4. B-Trees

B-Trees are self-balancing search trees designed to work efficiently on disk-based storage systems. Unlike AVL and Red-Black trees, B-Trees are not binary trees; each node can have more than two children.

### Properties:
1. All leaves are at the same level.
2. A non-leaf node with k children contains k-1 keys.
3. Each node (except root) must contain at least t-1 keys, where t is the minimum degree of the B-tree.
4. All nodes (including root) may contain at most 2t-1 keys.
5. Number of children of a node is equal to its number of keys plus one.

### Operations:

#### 4.1 Search
Similar to binary search tree, but with multiple keys in each node.

#### 4.2 Insertion
1. If the node is not full, insert the key into the appropriate position.
2. If the node is full:
   a. Split the node
   b. Move the median key to the parent
   c. Repeat the process for the parent if necessary

#### 4.3 Deletion
1. If the key is in a leaf node, simply remove it.
2. If the key is in an internal node:
   a. Replace the key with its in-order predecessor or successor
   b. Delete the predecessor or successor from the appropriate child
3. If the node becomes under-full, borrow keys from siblings or merge nodes.

### Time Complexity:
- Search: O(log n)
- Insertion: O(log n)
- Deletion: O(log n)

### Space Complexity:
- O(n) for storing n keys

### Advantages:
1. Efficient for systems that read and write large blocks of data
2. Minimizes disk I/O operations
3. Suitable for databases and file systems

### Disadvantages:
1. Complex implementation
2. Not as efficient as other self-balancing trees for in-memory operations
